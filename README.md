# ðŸ“š scala-algs ðŸ’»
Algorithms, data structures, and coding problems from Coursera, Textbooks, and HackerRankâ€”all using Scala.

Descriptions of the algorithms and data structures are written in comments or `*.MD` files as summaries.


### Flame War ðŸ”¥
All data structures and algorithms in this repository are written both functionally and 
imperatively for pedagogical reasons. Imperative, mutable code is not encouraged in the Scala community. However, 
mutable data structures and imperative algorithms are used, to reduce time spent on translating imperative code to 
functional code and to focus on algorithm-analysis. Most de-facto data structures and algorithm analysis resources 
write implementations using mutable data structures and imperative algorithms. 

### D.I.Y. â˜­
Although there are few resources providing a functional approach to algorithms and data structures, this repository is
made to encourage others to D.I.Y. implement their own functional algorithms and data structures. Taking the necessary 
steps to document alternative implementations can help others learn alternative functional algorithm implementations 
and immutable data structure implementations.
