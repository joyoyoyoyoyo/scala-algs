For M union-find operations on a set of N objects,
+ Algorithm: quick-find is O(M*N) in worst-case time
+ Algorithm: quick-union is O(M*N) in worst-case time
+ Algorithm: weighted quick-union is O(N + M*log(N)) in worst-case time
+ Algorithm: quick-union + path compression is O(N + N*log(N)) in worst-case time
+ Algorithm: weighted quick-union is O(N + M*log(N)) in worst-case time
+ Algorithm: weighted quick-union + path compression is O(N + M*log(N)) in worst-case time
