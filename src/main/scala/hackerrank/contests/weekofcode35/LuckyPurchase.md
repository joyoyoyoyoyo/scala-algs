# Lucky Purchase

Sharon wants to buy a laptop for programming. She plans on buying a laptop whose price is made of digits 4 and 7 only. The number of 4s and 7s in the price should be equal. You are given laptop brand names and their prices. Find and print the name of the laptop brand that satisfies the above criteria. If there are multiple brands that meet the criteria, print the name of the one with the minimum price. If none of the laptops meet the criteria print -1.

For example, if Sharon has a choice between laptops 'BestBook' priced at 444777 and 'LapBook' priced at 7744, the solution should indicate ideal choice to be 'LapBook'. Although both 'BestBook' and 'LapBook' have equal number of 4s and 7s in the price, 'LapBook' is priced lower which makes it the right choice for Sharon.

__Input Format__

The first line contains an integer n, denoting the number of laptops. 
The next n lines contains one string (name of company laptop) and an integer describing the value of each laptop.

__Constraints__
* 1 <= n <= 10^5
* 1 <= length of name of laptop <= 10
* name of laptop consists of English letters only.
* 1 <= price of laptop <= 10^9
Both name and price for laptops are unique.

__Output Format__

If answer doesn't exist, print -1. 
Otherwise, print the name of the brand whose laptop costs the least (minimum lucky number) and meets the required criteria.

__Sample Input 0__
```
4
HackerBook 777444
RankBook 3
TheBook 777
BestBook 47
```

__Sample Output 0__
```
BestBook
```

__Explanation 0__

Both 'HackerBook' and 'BestBook' meet the given conditions (equal number of 4s and 7s in the price), and since BestBook has a lower price, it becomes the correct choice and hence is displayed as ouput.

__Sample Input 1__

```
1
abacab 121

```

__Sample Output 1__
```
-1
```

__Explanation 1__

Since 121 does not consists of 4s and 7s we don't have any laptop satisfying the criteria. Hence, we print -1.
